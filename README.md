An implementation of transformer model in JAX in pure-functional style.
Inspired by https://github.com/awf/functional-transformer and https://github.com/vpj/jax_transformer/

## TODO
- [ ] Add property testing
- [ ] Use `jaxtyping` for type annotations
- [ ] How to print a model declared as a function `print(model)`
- [ ] Add documentation on how to define a new model
